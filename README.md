## Project summary

The goal of this project is to develop a neural network able to recognize the language spoken by a person, given a short audio clip of his/her voice. The network is trained on a dataset that we produced on our own. This dataset contains audio clips of people speaking in 3 languages: italian, english and french. The network is trained on a modified version of the mel spectrograms: MFCC (mel frequency cepstral coefficients) extracted from the audio clips, and it is able to tell apart the 3 different languages. This convolutional neural network runs on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, using Tensorflow Lite for Microcontrollers library

The dataset is kept private for privacy purposes.

## Project structure

The project is structured as follows:

- [Arduino audio recorder](arduino&#32;audio&#32;recorders/): contains arduino code meant to record audio data and store it on the SD card of the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, or send it to a computer via serial port
- [Audio recording notebooks](data_recorder_notebooks/): contains jupyter notebooks used to transform binary data into WAV audio files, and process them. They can also listen to a serial port and record audio data from it, saving the raw data in a file
- [Course Noteooks](haeeai_course_notebooks/): contains jupyter notebooks used to train the neural network, and to test it. Taken from the professor of our university course
- [arduinoMFCC library](libraries/arduinoMFCC/): contains the arduino library used to extract MFCC from audio data. This library can be executed both in an arduino environment and in a computer linux environment
- [C++ MFCC scripts](MFCC_script_cpp/): contains a C++ script that uses the arduinoMFCC library to extract MFCC from audio data. It can be executed in a linux environment
- [Arduino TFMicro Inference with MFCC](MFCC_script_arduino/): contains an arduino script that uses the arduinoMFCC library to extract MFCC from audio data. It can be executed in an arduino environment. It also uses a tfmicro model to make inference about a short audio clip recorded from the microcontroller itself. This folder contains the core of this project.
- [Models](model_lite/): contains the Tensorflow model, the Tensorflow Lite model and the TFMicro model (C bytes array) used to make inference on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
- [dataset_creator](dataset_creator.ipynb): jupyter notebook used to create the dataset and the splitting between training and validation
- [training_network](training_net.ipynb): jupyter notebook used to train the neural network, quantize the model into TFLite and convert to TFMicro. Then evaluates the model on the different test sets created ad hoc
- [Report](Spoken&#32;Language&#32;Recognition&#32;-&#32;Project&#32;Report.pdf): report of the project
- [Presentation](Spoken&#32;Language&#32;Recognition&#32;-&#32;Project&#32;Presentation.pptx): presentation of the project
